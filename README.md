# Console-Calculator
C++ console calculator

C++ console program that allows a user to enter two numbers, followed by one of four arithmetic operators (+,-,/,*). The program will validate all inputs are correct, otherwise kick an error back to the user. The program then performs the operation with the inputs given, displays a message if the result is between one and one hundred, and then displays the result as float and integer. Lastly, the program will ask the user for their first and last name, and then repeat it back to them.
